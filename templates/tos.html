	<li>
		Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials 
		(information or software) on BoostBlocks's web site for personal, 
		non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, 
		not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:
		
		<ol type="i">
			<li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
			<li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);</li>

<h3>
	3. Charges and Refund Policy
</h3>

<p>
	For all purchased resources and services, we will charge your credit card on a weekly basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on BoostBlocks's measurements of your use of the BoostBlocks services, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of BoostBlocks and only in the form of credit for the BoostBlocks services. Nothing in these Terms and Conditions obligates BoostBlocks to extend credit to any party. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to BoostBlocks may be shared by BoostBlocks with companies who work on BoostBlocks's behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to BoostBlocks and servicing your account. BoostBlocks may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. BoostBlocks shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. BoostBlocks reserves the right to discontinue the provision of the BoostBlocks services to you for any late payments.
